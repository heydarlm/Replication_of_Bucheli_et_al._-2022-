# Replication Study: Temperature Effects on Crop Yields in Heat Index Insurance

This repository contains R codes for the replication study of Bucheli et al. (2022) titled "Temperature Effects on Crop Yields in Heat Index Insurance."

## Overview of R Codes:

1. **ags_merging_masud.R:** This script performs the data preparation process for the direct replication study at the municipality level.

2. **data_deduplicating_masud.R:** This script implements the data cleaning procedure for the direct replication yield data.

3. **data_1_plot.R:** Generates plots for the direct replication data at the farm level.

4. **data_2_plot.R:** Generates plots for the direct replication data at the municipality level.

5. **data_3_plot.R:** Generates plots for the extended replication data.

6. **full_project_direct_f_level.R:** Performs insurance calibration (with restricted cubic splines) and evaluation (with expected utility model) using farm-level direct replication data.

7. **full_project_direct_m_level.R:** Performs insurance calibration (with restricted cubic splines) and evaluation (with expected utility model) using municipality-level direct replication data.

8. **full_project_extended_m_level.R:** Performs insurance calibration (with restricted cubic splines) and evaluation (with expected utility model) using extended replication data.

## Usage:

To replicate the analysis conducted in the study, clone or download this repository and execute the R scripts in a suitable environment.
